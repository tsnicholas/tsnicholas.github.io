                Aspiring professional software developer. 
                After learning to code in high school, I excelled with my accomplishments using my critical thinking and problem solving skills. 
                Using those same skills today, I have gained high levels of proficiency in Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and more.
                I am determined to become a professional software developer when I leave college, and to do the best job I can possibly offer. 
                If you're interested to learn more about me and my compatibility for your position, then please contact me to find out more.
